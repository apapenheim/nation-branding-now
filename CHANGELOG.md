# Changelog

The Changelog tracks content changes to the *NBN* project. We try to provide a written description of what is new on the night following any revisions.

## v1.0.5 â€“ 31 October 2019

Happy Halloween! ðŸŽƒ This extra spooky release of *NBN* continues to build our catalogue of visual assets branding the Brazilian state by dusting off the ðŸ•¸ cobwebs ðŸ•¸ on some very old releases.

**Added:**

- A stub article for the visual identifier of the early Cardoso government (95-96).
- A ghost to the changelog. Boo! ðŸ‘»
