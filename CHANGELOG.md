# Changelog

The Changelog tracks content changes to the *NBN* project. We try to provide a written description of what is new by the night following any revisions. Check back often, we are on a nightly build schedule!

## v1.0.7 â€“ 2 November 2019

**Changed:**

- The late term Cardoso identity (2002) is a significant one, so I've selected some of the better sources out there illustrating its contentious nature. (Being careful to keep *NBN*'s own description neutral.) The standards manual for the logotype is of atypically poor construction (somewhere, for some reason, it was autotraced â€“ I am thinking this is a PDF production quirk in early versions of Corel??) so I've done some work to produce clean lockups, following the colour rules. Interestingly, their own standards manual does not follow the colour rules... as defined *in the standards manual*. I will be very glad to be putting Brazil, Corel-using nation, behind me. Hopefully the next country is somewhere Illustrator is standard, eh?

## v1.0.6 â€“ 1 November 2019

**Added:**

- Well, the pronouncement of quarter-century coverage for Brazil may have been a bit premature. I forgot the blip of a governmental brand instituted by Cardoso in 2002 â€“ and that one is a doozy, so today's stub will be a bit more substantial by the next morning.

**Changed:**

- Whew, 18 lockups constructed and a mountain of gazette citations later, a starter entry. The FHC 99â€“02 article is now fleshed out a bit, to the point where I feel it beneficial to get *something* online. Maybe a scholarly source or two and some newspaper clippings and this one will be servicible. 

## v1.0.5 â€“ 31 October 2019

Happy Halloween! ðŸŽƒ This extra spooky release of *NBN* continues to build our catalogue of visual assets branding the Brazilian state by dusting off the ðŸ•¸ cobwebs ðŸ•¸ on some very old releases.

**Added:**

- A stub article for the visual identifier of the early Cardoso government (95-96).
- Full legal citations for the late-first-term branding of the Cardoso government (97-98).
- The beginnings of an article on the second-term Cardoso identifier(99-02). Definitely needs more work, but this closes the gap! *NBN* now has complete federal coverage for Brazil from 1995 to present.
- A ghost to the changelog. Boo! ðŸ‘»

**Changed:**

- Light orthographic modifications to the footer.

## v1.0.4 â€“ 30 October 2019

**Added:**

- Brazilian federal government 2016-2018 visual identity, previously a mis-labelled draft on the wrong page, is now live.
- Pages for the visual identity of the first and second Dilma mandates started.
- Stub article for the Lula (2003-2011) government.

**Changed:**

- Some resources served through a deprecated CDN have been migrated into LFS on BR 2019-2022.
- Donor change jar added to the footer. If this project is your kind of thing, why not chip in? :-)

## v1.0.3 â€“ 26 August 2019

**Added:**

- Brazilian federal government 2019-2022 visual identity.

**Changed:**

- Hitting some API limits on the current asset-serving platform. Phasing in a Git LFS solution.

## v1.0.2 â€“ 20 August 2019
