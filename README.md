## Avant-propos

**Nation Branding Now** (*NBN*) is a repository of visual assets used to brand the state (as well as your favourite sub-national administrative divisions!). Corporate brand management is in ascendance within the public sphere. In an interdependent world where borders and boundaries appear increasingly blurred, careful control of a cohesive jurisdictional "brand" serves to construct distinctiveness. *NBN* seeks to chronicle the rapidly-evolving process through which states create, redefine, and control national identity.

In the *NBN* project, one will find a historical catalogue of brand identity strategies, logos, books, and memos issued by governments near and far, small and large, wealthy and less-so. Whether you are a social scientist wading into this exciting sub-domain of soft power, a designer looking for inspiration, or just a curious passer-by, you are cordially invited to take a look around.

The content of the project itself, including content linked to or furnished by third parties, has heterogeneous use limitations. The docs contain [a short primer on re-use](https://nationbrandingnow.com/guide/use.html) if one wishes to duplicate *NBN* content. Do be aware that some protected government marks and emblems have very narrowly-defined or exceptional protections under law. It comes with the territory â€“ we are an open reference that describes protected marks, so some assets are by their very nature non-free and require the end user to have a statutory exception.
