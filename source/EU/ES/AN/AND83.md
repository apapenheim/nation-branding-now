## Details

**Client:** Junta de Andalucía (Sevilla, Andalucía)

**Designer:** *Unknown*

**Years in use:** 1983-1985

**Remarks:** The Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed on 30 December 1981 (following a 1980 autonomy referendum) and first elected a parliament in 1982. Despite this, they did not legislate a unique governmental identifier until October 1983. The roots of this symbol, a simplification of the coat of arms, stretch back much further. The coat of arms, dating to 1918, is the work of Blas Infante. As there was no real *government* to speak of and this is a project about *governmental identification*, *NBN* will devote little space to earlier realizations of the coat of arms. This is not a heraldic sciences site, [but we can recommend a good one](https://sites.google.com/site/simbolosdeandalucia/el-escudo-de-andalucia).

The symbol eschews the Pillars of Hercules, lions, and bare-chested mythic hero of the coat of arms, instead offering an abbreviated "J.A." (*Junta de Andalucía*) against a national triband in a curled frame.

Note that application of this symbol was far from unified within the young government. For the entire period of time the symbol was legally in force, there are examples of government publications abrogating the guidelines and opting to represent the administration with the full coat of arms. The arms were typically reproduced alongside an unidentified outline font. Observe: A bicolour, outlined application with a green archway and triband ([1983](/assets/EU/ES/AN/AND83/book1.jpg)); an alternative simplification, in black, removing all text from the coat of arms ([1985](/assets/EU/ES/AN/AND83/book2.jpg)); and an inverse application with the full coat of arms, text included, entirely in white ([1985](/assets/EU/ES/AN/AND83/book3.jpg)).

Observing the systematic deviation from the gazetted symbol, it is little wonder that this simplification, criticized in official documents for eschewing figurative representation (Decreto 126/1985), was quickly replaced with Alberto Corazón's [stylizd coat of arms](AND85.html).
