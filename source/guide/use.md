# Reusing Content on NBN

Content on *Nation Branding Now* is selected and made available with the exclusive use and benefit of users undertaking their own **private study** in mind. This is not to say that other uses are discouraged – No, please, cite this! Talk about it with friends! – only that the philosophy behind our curation of materials was with private study in mind. Should one wish to make use of content *seen here* or *linked to from* here for some other purpose, there are a few things to keep in mind. How one should proceed depends largely upon the type of content.

## What we wrote

Textual content (this includes but is not limited to the *User Guide* you are reading now, the content of the "Remarks" field excepting blockquotes, and all bibliographic annotations in our documentation).

Blockquotes in the "Remarks" field are typically not of *NBN* authorship. Each comes with an accompanying reference.

## Images

Tread lightly. *NBN* does not own, never implies to own, and disclaims all ownership of the symbols depicted in image panes. We use symbols, wordmarks, and other visual identifiers to convey the meaning intendedEvery effort is made to identify and name the relevant rights-holder in the space immediately beneath our image panes.

Re-use is complicated. Many of these graphic representations are protected by trade-mark law, copyright law, both, or more. Do be aware that even for certain non-commercial purposes, the relevant authority may require a grant of permission to reproduce their mark. If the purpose of use is for commercial or personal gain, one should without question go direct to the agency or council managing the mark.

Due to the nature of the symbols catalogued (governmental identification), some official identifying marks are quite exceptionally protected. Misrepresentation while using a protected mark can be a very serious offence. See, among many others, Canada's concept of [Prohibited Marks](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr03109.html#offmark) and the relevant section of the [Norwegian Penal Code](https://lovdata.no/NLE/lov/2005-05-20-28/§section165). *NBN* strongly recommends consulting the laws of the source jurisdiction and one's home jurisdiction before using an official mark for any purpose.

## Linked articles and other third-party content

The content we link to is, with few exceptions, not written by *NBN*,
