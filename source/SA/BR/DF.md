## Subordinate Collections

Subdividing the Distrito Federal into municipalities is expressly forbidden by the Brazilian Constitution. The DF instead has 32 administrative regions (regiões administrativas), directly administered by appointees of the District government. As such, they tend not to brand themselves.

*NBN* has no records to display here yet. Bummer.
