## Details

**Client:** Governo Federal do Brasil (Brasília, DF)

**Designer:** Secretaria Especial de Comunicação Social (*SECOM*) (Brasília, DF)

**Years in use:** 2015-2016

**Remarks:** This is the visual identifier used during the second mandate of the Dilma Rousseff government. It was introduced 1 January 2015, designed by SECOM. The mark was deprecated on 12 May 2016, following the Senate's suspension of Rousseff's presidential powers in favour of [Vice President Michel Temer](ORDEM.html) during impachment proceedings. The wordmarks bears many similarities to that of [Rouseff's previous term](DILMA.html), essentially a mere slogan swap: *País Rico é País sem Pobreza* ("A Rich Country is a Country without Poverty") to *Pátria Educadora* ("The Nation that Teaches"). A stylized "Brasil" in bold, green, rounded text is set against a yellow field, with the counter of the A defaced by a yellow rhombus and star field recalling the Brazilian flag. Stacked above and below are governmental identifiers and slogans, in a Gotham-like typeface.
