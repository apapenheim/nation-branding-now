## Details

**Client:** Governo Federal do Brasil (Brasília, DF)

**Designer:** *Unknown*

**Years in use:** 1990-1992

**Remarks:** This is the visual identifier used during the Fernando Collor de Mello government. A graphic rendition of the Brazilian flag – green rectangle, yellow half-lozenge, and blue semi-circle – is displayed above a bold, oblique neo-grotesque (Helvetica) in white on a navy field. The slogan device of this government was *Brasil Novo* ("New Brasil"), though this is nowhere to be found in the graphic itself.

*NBN* does not know much about this mark. Were were the type to speculate, it is likely the work of *SECOM*. Colour values and four distinct constructions (quadrichrome, monochrome, and inversed versions of each) have been divined through careful study of well-preserved government publications from 1990–92 available, but no normative document defining any reference colours was located. Nothing about this mark appears to have been gazetted in the *Diário Oficial da União*. If you have any materials from the communications ministry that could help us write a more complete and correct entry, please do get in touch.

#### Page Clipping

**Publication Title:** 1991 – Preparação para o futuro
**Publisher:** Secretaria da Imprensa da Presidência da República
**Date:** 1991 **Page:** 26
**Remarks:** This publicity pane is offered to illustrate use of the *Brasil Novo* slogan, which does not appear in lockup with the visual symbols themselves. The logo on this page is distorted, apparently stretched horizontally to match the dimensions of the *Caixa Econômica Federal* wordmark, and should *not* be taken as authoritative.
