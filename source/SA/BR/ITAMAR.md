## Details

**Client:** Governo Federal do Brasil (Brasília, DF)

**Designer:** Secretaria Especial de Comunicação Social (*SECOM*) (Brasília, DF)

**Years in use:** 1992-1994

**Remarks:** The visual identifier used during the Itamar Franco government. Similar to the [Temer](ORDEM.html) wordmark, the early publication date (Franco did not formally assume the office until extremely late in the year, 29 December 1992) likely stems from serving as *acting* president during impeachment proceedings against [his predecessor](COLLOR.html). A Brazilian flag waves in the simulated breeze, superimposed over a yellow triangle that is reminiscent of [the flag of Minas Gerais](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandeira_de_Minas_Gerais), the state of which he was a native. What appears at a glance to be a four-colour logo is, in actuality, a five-colour logo. The yellow of the lozenge on the flag, CMYK(0,10,100,0), contains 10 per cent magenta to distinguish it from the CMYK(0,0,100,0) triangle. A bold neo-grotesque face beneath the flag reads *Brasil, União de Todos* ("Brazil, Union of Everyone") in blue. The graphic standards do not specify a typeface, but *NBN* has found the display weight of Scangraphic's Europa Grotesk to be a very close match. Any other bold Helvetica clone would serve just as capably.

There are two known variants of this logo. The first, and the only one *NBN* has seen described in the standards guide deposited with the Presidential Archives, features the flag waving quite vigorously while attached to a mast and halyard. On the second, the flag is larger and flapping more leisurely, seemingly suspended in mid-air. The latter example is much more commonly the one displayed in both scholarly articles on the topic and the contemporary press. And *NBN* does not believe it to be invalid! Many publications in the Presidential Archives and governmental advertisements noted by the project do seem to employ the mast-less variant. Where we *do* depart from the more common depictions of this symbol (see: [Alaic (2018)](/assets/SA/BR/Alaic2018.pdf), [Antonio C. de Sousa (2019)](http://tonykarlos.com/profi/nova-marca-governo-federal/), [Wikipedia (2015)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logomarca_do_governo_Itamar_Franco.jpg)) is that, in our review of government publications, *we do not feel that the example with black text was dominant*. A blue-text rendition of this mark was vastly more common. The tilde on the Ã was, in every example *NBN* observed, rendered as a parallelogram. We feel the swung example showing up in contemporary press is an error that stems from [dubious source material on Wikipedia that informed subsequent vectorizations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/e/e2/20151024202535%21Logomarca_do_governo_Itamar_Franco.jpg). Graphic standards likely exist describing this modification of the logo, which saw synchronous use with the halyard variant in both 1993 and 1994, but the NBN Project has not located them.
