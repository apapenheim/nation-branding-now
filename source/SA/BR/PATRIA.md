# Pátria Amada – Brasil

## Image

<img src="https://img.nationbrandingnow.com/file/nbn-photos/SA/BR/PATRIA_pane.png" class="focus-image">

## Details

**Client:** Governo Federal do Brasil (Brasília, DF)

**Designer:** Secretaria Especial de Comunicação Social (*SECOM*) (Brasília, DF)

**Years in use:** 2019-2022

**Remarks:** This is the visual identifier used by the Bolsonaro government. The mark was introduced 4 January 2019 on social media by SECOM. Type is [Signika](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Signika) by Anna Giedryś. The slogan, *Pátria Amada* ("Beloved Homeland"), is derived from the national anthem. The wordmark is available in horizonal and vertical lockup, while use of the symbol (a stylized Brazilian flag) on its own is not permitted by the standards guide. Do note that this logo was initially launched (see launch video below) with type in a different colour and weight. No vector examples of the original construction have been noted in print by *NBN*. As our standards manual is dated 17 January 2019, the alternate construction cannot have been in use for long. Despite this, one will occasionally encounter the blue-text logo in mass media, particularly in articles written immediately following the soft launch on social media.

## Documentation

#### Graphic Standards

**Title:** Manual de Uso da Marca do Governo Federal
**Author:** Secretaria Especial de Comunicação Social
**Date:** 2019
**Remarks:** *NBN* has noted two public versions of the primary standards manual from SECOM. One has a filename versioned v06, while the other is marked v07. An automated text and graphics comparison ran on the two documents, of identical filesize, indicates zero changes between them. Both are time-stamped 14:23:48 on 17 January 2019. We do have the purported "v07" document in offline storage should one wish to attempt a more in-depth review of what we have reasonably concluded to be identical files. It is not known, but presumed, that the earlier five versions of this document were working copies.
